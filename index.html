            <p>The events discussed here precede the stories of the anime Ensemble Stars. Before the tension, Yumenosaki Private Academy attracted students to its campus of prestige. Once accepted, the students tended to let their school's name speak for their talent instead of pursuing their singing careers respectively. The student Tenshouin Eichi felt so profoundly affronted by the slacker culture of Yumenosaki Private Academy, he began to demand only the highest standards for all students enrolled, and that slackers must be expelled. Tenshouin was angry that he could not perform because of his ill health, and thus resented his classmates' physical capacity to do something he had always desired: to perform on stage. Hasumi Keito, childhood friend and student council vice president at Yumenosaki, decided to assist Tenshouin. Tenshouin enlisted Aoba Tsumugi to use the latter's social connections to encourage more students at Yumenosaki to follow Tenshouin's dream of reforming the school.</p>
            <p>
                This group of students chose five of Yumenosaki's most talented and hard working students to scapegoat: Sakuma Rei, Hibiki Wataru, Shinkai Kanata, Itsuki Shu, and Sakasaki Natsume. Tenshouin started rumors about the work ethic and influence of these five students, claiming these "slackers" encouraged the rest of Yumenosaki Private Academy to slack on their own work ethic. Eichi and his group encouraged the whole school to bully their five targets such that the second year targets hid Sakasaki who was a first year at the time. Upon establishing these five students as the villains, Tenshouin started a musical group to challenge in musical competition the villains he created. Tenshouin made Aoba the leader of their music group to increase the group's appeal and popularity. After defeating the villain music group, Tenshouin became the student council president and thus gained the power to change school rules to match his vision of demanding perfection from each pupil.
            </p>
            <p>Tenshouin created rules including: requiring musical acts to have a two member minimum, requiring each musical act to send a request to the student council for permission to perform, requiring each student at Yumenosaki Private Academy to participate in clubs and activities, and requiring all musical acts to perform during the Dream Idol Festival. Tenshouin's musical act became the best at Yumenosaki because Tenshouin took advantage of the loopholes he wrote into the language of the rules he created. These same rules saw students suffer academically due to lack of access to opportunities to perform, with Tenshouin in control of which musical acts get to perform in the first place. Because Tenshouin demanded industry quality performances from musical acts at school, no act could earn any recognition by expressing their creativity. The pressure Tenshouin placed on the students at Yumenosaki caused many students to fail at school, with some even deciding to unalive themselves by jumping off the school roof. Aoba destroyed all evidence of these events from the school. Survivors of this series of events have chosen to keep secret all memory of them. Instead of developing a better reputation for Yumenosaki Private Academy, all Tenshouin got was lifeless bodies on school grounds and nightmares about his actions.</p>
