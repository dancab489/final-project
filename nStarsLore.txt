this was a yearish prior to the stories of enstars, since yumenosaki (the school) was a very good school to get into mosy of the students just slacked off since tgey thought just having tge school on their reusme be enough so not many people actually tried to become idols and eichi Tenshouin who lovef idols was so angry tgat nobody was trying to become an idol and everyone was wasting their opertunities and he was angry because most of the time he was in tge hospital and wasn't capable like the other students were so he decided that he was going to reform the school to be perfect idols and get rid of the slackers so he came up with a plan and keito Hasumi had joined in since he also wanted make the school better they didny rlly know how to do it so eichi befriended tsumugi who at the time eas a very well known and friendly person so eichi could use his social connections. so their plan was to gather a group of 5 people now known as the five eccentrics (who were extremely talented and smart) and eichi knew nobody wanted to blame themselves for tgeir behaviors so the purpose of the 5 eccentrics was to put all the blame on those 5, since they were so talented idols rumors spread that they didnt have to work hard and were encouraging slacking so tge school bullied them relentlessly as a result for yumenosakis slacking in stufents and the five were : rei, wataru, kanata, shu and natsume. eichi had picked rei, wataru and kanata while tsumugi picked natsume and shu but tge eccentrics would always hide natsume as a way for him to not be bullied as much bc at the time he was a first year while the rest were second years because he was so young so after the five eccentrics have been established as the villans eichi had made a unit called fine to fight against the five and seem like the heros. so eichi would use the students desires to be heros and would gain popularity with that eichi made tsumugi the leader of fine because he was very frienfly and woulf add to their act of being the heros after that they woulf gain in popularity after beating the eccentrics and eichi was then made into the student council president so since eichi was now the president he was able to chgabge the rules of yumenosaki eichi made rules like unit members have to be 2 at minimum which was a problem for some of the eccentrics who would rather to work alone and he also made it a rule that whenever units woulf want to preform they would have to send a request to the student council to be approved so eichi basically also controled who and who didn't preform with keitos suggestion clubs and activities were mandatory as a way to tire out the eccentrics so they woulf be so exhausted with school, activities and idol work and he created the dream idol festival to yet again make it harder for tge eccentrics, if they didnt participate their accomplishments woulf not be recognized anf woulf be rankef basically at rock botton so fine woulf do loopholes to become the best unit at the school but this slso affectef the other stufents snf if they didn't do well in the drefes their grsdes woulf go down and woulf flunk out and thid woulf slso make conflicts within units anf caused minor "wars" and since the stufent council basically controlled everything it was hard to have performances happen with was hard to have any creativity because eichi wasnt trying to make new idols he eas trying to make idols that fit the entertainment industries standards and because of all this happening mosy stufenys lost basically everything abd woulf either drop oit jump off the roof and jill themselves and yumenosaki basivally became a graveyard tw at tge end and now yumenosakis reputation is back to normal because of the actions of tsumugi burning all the records so any history of thst eas erased so none of the present first years have a clue about what had happened and the second and third years do not ever talk about oy but even if the events ending it was assumed that if anyone were to go to the rooftop it was for suicide and with all these events keito and tsumugi dont have much guilt towards what had happened eichi on the other hand has expressed his guily and he has nightmares about it frequently but keito did say that he wouldnt ley anything else like that happen again
