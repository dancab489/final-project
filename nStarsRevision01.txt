The events discussed here precede the stories of the anime Ensemble Stars. Before the war, Yumenosaki Private Academy attracted students to its campus of prestige. Once accepted, the students tended to let their school's name speak for their talent instead of pursuing their singing careers respectively. The student Tenshouin Eichi felt so profoundly affronted by the slacker culture of Yumenosaki Private Academy, he began to demand only the highest standards for all students enrolled, and that slackers must be expelled. Tenshouin was angry that he could not perform because of his ill health, and thus resented his classmates' physical capacity to do something he had always desired: to perform on stage. Hasumi Keito, childhood friend and student council vice president at Yumenosaki, decided to assist Tenshouin.
